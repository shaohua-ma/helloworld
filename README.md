# Hello Word App
This project is to evaluate the best process to create a Spring Boot project and save it in github.

## Notes
All operations/commands are local unless explicitly stated as REMOTE. All the git commands are executed in the local project directory.
 * create a spring boot project locally
 * create git repo: `git init`
 * commit all changes: `git commit -m "init commmit."`
 * REMOTE. create a git repo in github. say, `helloworld`.
 * link local repo with remote one as `origin`: `git remote add origin https://github.com/shaohua-ma/helloworld.git`
 * push local to remote: `git push -u origin master`
